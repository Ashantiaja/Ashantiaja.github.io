## Project Description
This holds HW3 for UNR CS 330 Fall 2019. To exhibit the MVC design pattern, the web app will simulate keeping a class roster.

The project will supposedly be hosted on github.com

## Assignment:
Build any web application you like, using the MVC design pattern. You may use whatever Technology you like ...

There should be a data storage component. If you've taken a databases class, try Postgres or mySQL. If not, a flat file will do, but you'll have to implement your own data loader.

There should be a framework component. Try Google Web Toolkit or Play! for Java or another language/framework you feel comfortable with.

There should be a webpage component. HTML is fine, CSS is better, Javascript might not be a bad idea.
